# CPU architecture (beginner materials)

## Video courses

1. [Crash course on computing, videos #1 to #21](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&si=g7C1SamcjVqkt9vH)

## Emulators

1. [Johnny assembler](https://dev.inf-schule.de/content/12_rechner/4_johnny/johnny3/)

## Exercises

### Memory addressing

1. In writing and pictures explain to me, how reading from RAM and writing to RAM works (using the schematic we used
   on our lesson - TODO add here). Then explain how the same mechanism works in Johnny emulator and ARM.
2. What is a word size and address space of the Johnny computer/ARM32 cpu. Why?
3. Basic calculations with CPU freq. and memory access times. E.g. memory has a frequency 2000MHz and it takes 50 cycles
   to fetch a new byte from the memory. How long does it take in seconds? (yes some fellas have problem with such a simple stuff)
4. What does LSB and msb mean? What is little-Endianness, what is big-Endianness?

### Assmbler coding

1. Write a algorithm that finds a given value in an array.
2. Write a bubble sort algorithm in ARM32 assembler.
3. Write a strcmp() algorithm in ARM32 assembler.
4. Write a memcpy()
5. Other <cstring> functions <ttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cstring>
6. Write a simple string find algorithm in ARM32 assembler.
7. Write an array order reversal algorithm in ARM32 assembler.
8. String replace
9. strstr()
10. ...
